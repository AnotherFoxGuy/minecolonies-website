  <p>
    Minecolonies is an interactive Town building mod that allows you to create your own thriving Town within
    Minecraft. It depicts real-life scenarios by providing you with different craftable options to build
    your own Town and enhance your gaming experience. Featuring many NPC workers such as: Builders,
    Crafters, Farmers, Fishermen, Guards, Barracks, Miners, Smeltery, Baker, Cook/Restuarant, Deliveryman,
    Animal Herders and many more planned for development. As well as a specialized buildings such as:
    Warehouse, Citizen Huts and a Townhall. Minecolonies gives you the ability to create a colony as rich
    and unique as every player.
  </p>

  <h3>Governance</h3>
  <p>
    You have full control of how to build your Town. You determine how many workers you want or need, what
    type of workers, where they will live, and hire or fire as you see fit. Creating a Town at your own
    pace. It is your Town to design and develop, you are the designer, administrator and boss.
  </p>

  <h3>Security and Replenishment</h3>
  <p>
    Your Town deserves the best security you can have. Strategically add Guard Towers or Tower Barracks to
    protect your Town from hostile mobs and barbarians that will attack on random nights. Give them the best
    weapons and armour your Town has to offer. They need to be fed well to work and protect it better. Keep
    a busy farmer to supply the baker and the cook at the restaurant, so no one goes hungry.
  </p>

  <h3>Have fun, Play with Friends</h3>
  <p>
    Minecolonies has a very powerful multiplayer system and an awesome tool for learning about Town
    planning, building and especially management. The permission system allows for collaborative team play
    in multiplayer where you can assign different roles in a Town such as; Officer, Friend, Neutral or even
    Hostile! Also have individual competing colonies at the same time, all with a strong protection system
    for server management and Anti-Griefing. Fun for all!
